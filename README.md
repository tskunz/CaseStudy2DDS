# Executive Summary for DDS Project 2

Frito-Lay Executive Leadership wants to understand attrition at the company. After analysis of the data DDSAnalytics has found an attrition rate at Frito-Lay of 15.91%. This project will explore the correlations between attrition and other variables, as well as provide models to predict attrition. A K-NN model and linear regression model will be used to predict attrition, and the models will be fit using the top two positive and negative correlated variables to attrition. The variables being fit to the models with their respective correlation values are Overtime (+0.27), Employee Age Below 30 (+0.17), Job Involvement (-0.18), and Job Level (-0.16).
